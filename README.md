# Machine-Learning-Project

This project is the final assignment for Coursera IBM Machine Learning with Python Course.

Please note - this notebook was originally created by IBM for the project, I just filled in where needed to complete the assignment. 
The assignment was great practice for the all classification algorithms learned during the course.
K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Log Regression

The course also went over different forms of Clustering and Regression models.

Thank you!
